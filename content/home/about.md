# Biography

I am a software engineering master's student in the computer science department at The University of British Columbia.
My research interests center on human aspects of software development and include developer productivity, developer-tool interaction, and workflow automation.
More specifically, my work focuses on creating natural interfaces that streamline the software development process.

In a recent publication, _Conext-Aware Developer Assistants_ (Bradley, Fritz, & Holmes, ICSE'18), we examined the utility of natural interfaces for industry developers and found that it had the potential to simplify complex workflows.
I am continuing this work by trying to understand features of scripts found online in StackOverflow posts and in code repositories and providing developers with a means to leverage these scripts to help automate parts of their workflows more easily.

Prior to starting my master's, I worked as a full-stack software developer at a local company supporting the logistics and commodities industries.
This experience guides my research towards solutions that are impactful and relevant to industry.



<!-- I am now working on developing this area further by extracting commonly used scripts from online sources and through direct observation to develop a method of automating the creation of these scripts in a generalizable manner. -->
